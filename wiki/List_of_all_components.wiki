#summary List of all components

= Rich components =

my purpose was to create components which are easier to use and have more features: context sensitive menus, tooltips, mouse driven (like changing the value of a combobox by scrolling the mouse), at runtime locale changes (English and Dutch is supported) (all swing chooser components and dialog buttons also change locale at runtime), easier event-thread-safe programming, configuring components at instantiation by configuration object, drag and drop, searching and filtering, type based rendering and editing, and many more; a framework to build forms (validation, automatic binding of components) is also in development; many utility classes are created to make everything posible
